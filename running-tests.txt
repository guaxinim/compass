Testing Compass Distribution
=============================

Compass allows running all its tests with the "with-dependencies" distribution.
Simply executing "ant tests" (or build tests on windows) will run all the tests.

Specifying different test settings for most of the core tests can be done by 
adding a file called compass.test.properties. An example can be verifying that
compass can work with a certain database and Jdbc driver. An example for running
compass tests against MySql can be done by having the following properties in
the compass.test.properties file:

# BEGIN TEST PROPERTIES
compass.engine.connection=jdbc://jdbc:mysql:///test?emulateLocators=true
compass.engine.store.jdbc.dialect=org.apache.lucene.store.jdbc.dialect.MySQLInnoDBDialect
compass.engine.store.jdbc.connection.driverClass=com.mysql.jdbc.Driver
compass.engine.store.jdbc.connection.username=root
compass.engine.store.jdbc.connection.password=
compass.engine.useCompoundFile=false
# END TEST PROPERTIES
